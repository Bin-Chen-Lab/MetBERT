# Things updated along the way
1) udpated cleaning strategy
2) updated split from 70 15 15 to 80 10 10
3) shuffled and stratified at splitting
4) new optimizer with additional params
5) changed defaults for opti params and scheduler
6) added truncation strategies


# Tried but did not work
1) tried incorporating bucketiterator with dataloaders but max lenth is 512 and mainly used all the time in our case so it would not work
2) Tried weight balancing using smapler and modified loss function but no performance benefit. 
So finally decided to use stratification while splitting the data.
3) Tried head-tail-mixed approaches, did not have much time to optimzie them 
4) Tried different optimzer but got lower performnance
5) just training last layer did not help 
6) epochs 1,2,3 and 4. 4 is way better performing for pubmedbert and 2 is better for bio and clinical
but for consistency we kept epochs 4 for all model fine-tuning
7) Tried hyperparemetrs from 3 different papaers to replicate but no significant results
